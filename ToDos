KNOWN ISSUES
- Language for ZBW entries is always "de". Irrespective of the actual language of the recommended item. (see https://digital-jira.joanneum.at/browse/EEX-216)
- Vagrantfile doesn't allow reprovisioning (i.e. 'vagrant reload --provision')
- The "Results on" field is not filled when the tag-method (i.e. #exceess: keyword #) is used
- errorhandling should be enhanced. especially when the recommender doesn't answer!
- number of results should be displayed
- filteroptions for the resultslist
- dynamic change of the citationstyle
