KNOWN ISSUES
- Language for ZBW entries is always "de". Irrespective of the actual language of the recommended item. (see https://digital-jira.joanneum.at/browse/EEX-216)
- Vagrant file doesn't allow reprovisioning (i.e. 'vagrant reload --provision')
- The "Results on" field is not filled when the tag-method (i.e. #exceess: keyword #) is used
- error handling should be enhanced. especially when the recommender doesn't answer!
- number of results should be displayed
- filter options for the results list
- dynamic change of the citation style


TODOS/Upcoming improvements
- Incorporating EEXCESS modules
   - Recommendation dashboard
   - Result list (optional)
- Polish the plug-in up, to make it available in the plug-in market at wordpress.com
- Implement user profiles
- Make use of citeproc-js' localization skills
- Nice features:
   - Displaying the providers that contributed to the result
   - Giving the user the opportunity to influence the number of results (and thereby the response time)
- Uploading the project to Wordpress Plugin Directory
   - Creation of good readme file (https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/readme.txt ). Covering “What, how, when and where” questions.
   - Upload to Wordpress' SVN repo
