== Description ==

= Short Description =
The [**EEXCESS**](http://eexcess.eu/) (*Enhancing Europe’s eXchange in Cultural Educational and Scientific reSources*) is a European Union funded project. EEXCESS WordPress plug-in is an application which provides users with recommendations of cultural, economics, media and scholarly communication content while editing or writing blog posts.

= Long Description =
European museums, archives, libraries and other cultural aggregators hold vast resources of cultural, scientific and educational content—scientific research, historical sound recordings, images of sculptures, films, sheet music and much more. This highly specialised, carefully curated content is still largely untapped and invisible to the general public. The EEXCESS (*Enhancing Europe’s eXchange in Cultural Educational and Scientific reSources*) is a European Union funded project and it's vision is to connect these valuable resources with the main stream content over Web. EEXCESS research is based on the simple principle of taking the content to the user, not the user to the content. Instead of navigating through a multitude of libraries, repositories and databases, users will find relevant and specialised information in their habitual environment. The EEXCESS Wordpress plug-in is designed for this purpose.

This is an appropriate tool for bloggers who are writing posts on historical, cultural or scientific content. It serves as recommendation tool for user’s online activities. You, as a user, will get personally tailored recommendations from cultural and scientific databases without having to explicitly search for this content. This plugin will integrate into your ongoing working process. You won´t have to leave the website you are currently reading or the content management system you are currently editing.

So far, EEXCESS recommends content from the following cultural and scientific databases:

*	[Europeana](http://www.europeana.eu/) (cultural content)
*	[EconBiz](http://www.econbiz.de/) (economic literature)
*	[Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/) (scientific papers of a wide range of disciplines)
*	[KIM BL](https://kgdb.bl.ch/kim-kgs/) (regional cultural content, Baselland, Switzerland)
*	Deutsche Digitale Bibliothek

**Further content databases will be available soon.**
